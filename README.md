# Atomic Design

Set of rules :

- The atoms should be written without margins and positions;
- Only the molecules and organisms can set the positions of atoms, but these stacks canâ€™t have any styles of margins and positions;
- Templates have only one function: to set the grid of pages but never positions of specific components;

## Breakdown

- if a component has logic -> move it to Organism
- else
  - if component has other components inside it -> move it to Molecules
  - else it's an Atom

### Example

- Button is an Atom
- Card is a Molecule
- Component with Hooks is an Organism
